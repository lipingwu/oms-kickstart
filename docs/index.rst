Kickstart Open Mustard Seed
===========================

**A Framework for developing and deploying secure cloud applications to collect,
compute on, and share personal data**

The Open Mustard Seed project is an open-source framework for developing and
deploying web apps in a secure, user-centric personal cloud. The framework
provides a stack of core technologies that work together to provide a high level
of security and ease of use when sharing and collecting personal and
environmental data, controlling web-enabled devices, and engaging with others to
aggregate information and view the results of applied computation via protected
services.

The utilities included in the OMS-Kickstart repository are intended to make
deployment and provisioning of new hosts for OMS networks a simple and sensible
process.
